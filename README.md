# BLE-Mesh-Based-Home-Security-System

This project aims at creating a smart home security system using Bluetooth Low Energy. BLE Mesh is a computer mesh networking standard based on Bluetooth Low Energy that allows for many-to-many communication over Bluetooth radio. The project tries to improvise the home surveillance monitoring techniques by utilizing the following BLE Mesh advantages over the Security sensors based Data Acquisition Systems such as

Multipath Resilience provided by multiple paths
Power Efficiency
Extended Range
Being able to ensure the safety and security of the house remotely is very important. Getting house status updates with a button press and triggering notifications in case unauthorized users try to access the house, detecting human presence inside or outside the house at unusual hours, prototyping the laser beam security system using an ambient light sensor and noise level monitoring for advanced protection is todayâ€™s need. Crime rates have increased manifold due to lack of security systems installed. Being able to monitor your house efficiently and safeguarding the lives of our family by ensuring that the house is properly secured at all times is a crucial task. This project introduces advanced smart home security solutions and hence increases human comfort and security. We will be designing a home security system based on Bluetooth Mesh technology. It is a highly reliable and secure networking technology which enables many-to-many device communication. It provides interoperability through various communication layers such as the physical layer, collecting and dealing with analog and digital data and providing different solutions to users from the top. Our project will involve friend and low power nodes which will consist of multiple bluetooth mesh models and hence will thus ensure that different analog parameters are very well communicated from one node to the other as well as power of the whole system is efficiently conserved. Our system will grant access only to the authorized user when a button switch is pressed by the user. It will also save the logs of previous accesses and would report them to the friend node whenever needed. The low power nodes will also collect and send sensor data to the friend node when the user wishes to access it remotely by means of bluetooth mesh technology. The nodes will sleep in EM3 at all times except for the time when it transmits alerts and waits for the external button press event.
